# sample-systems - Collection of Sample Systems

This repo contains a set of sample systems suitable for loading
into a Backstage catalog. Current systems are mapped by organiation,
which include:
- "brodagroupsoftware.yaml": Broda Group Software systems

Note that the systems must have references to a valid domain.

A corresponding set of domains are mapped to identical file
names in the "sample-domains" repo.
